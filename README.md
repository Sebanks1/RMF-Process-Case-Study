# RMF Compliance and Authorization Project

## Overview
This project involved leading the **Risk Management Framework (RMF)** process for a large-scale IT infrastructure, ensuring compliance with **NIST SP 800-37** and **NIST SP 800-53**. The project aimed to manage the assessment and authorization of an information system while identifying security vulnerabilities and implementing mitigation strategies to enhance the security posture of the organization.

## Objectives
- **Ensure compliance** with relevant standards (NIST SP 800-37, NIST SP 800-53) for the information systems.
- **Conduct security assessments** and identify potential vulnerabilities across IT infrastructure.
- **Implement corrective actions** and develop risk mitigation strategies to ensure regulatory compliance.
- **Lead a cross-functional team** in the development and execution of security documentation, including security plans, security assessments, and authorization packages.
- **Collaborate with stakeholders** to prioritize security improvements and continuous monitoring of systems.

## Key Contributions
- Led the **RMF process** from initiation to system authorization, ensuring timely completion of all required tasks.
- Conducted in-depth **vulnerability assessments** to identify potential security gaps and provided solutions to address them.
- Developed and reviewed essential **security documentation**, including System Security Plans (SSPs), Security Assessment, and Continuous Monitoring strategies.
- Managed the **authorization package** process and facilitated smooth authorization approvals.

## Tools and Technologies Used
- **NIST SP 800-37** and **NIST SP 800-53**
- **RMF Methodology**
- **Security Documentation** (System Security Plans, Security Assessment Report, Plan of Action & Milestone (POA&M))
- **Risk Mitigation and Vulnerability Management Tools** (Tenable Nessus)

## Outcome
Successfully led the project to achieve full authorization for the information system, improving overall **security posture** and **compliance** with federal standards, while also ensuring ongoing risk management and continuous monitoring practices were in place.
